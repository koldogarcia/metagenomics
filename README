COMPARING OUTPUTS OF METAGENOMIC ASSIGNMENT PROGRAMS

comp.php is a simple script to compare the outputs of Naïve Bayesian Classifier, 
Lowest Common Ancestor (both implemented in FCP[1]) and Phymm [2].

USAGE

php comp.php nb_file lca_file phymm_file out_file [key_file]

where
nb_file: the file of Naïve Bayesian Classifier output
lca_file: the file of Lowest Common Ancestor output
phymm_file: the file of Phymm output
out_file: the generic name for output files
key_file: optional. a key file of original source of the reads. This file is used to
	calculate the wrong assignments from a simulated dataset. The format of the key_file
	should be name_of_read[tab]phylum;class;order;family;genus;sp[EOL]
	
Several output files are generated, all of them starting with the name selected in out_file
- *_taxalevel_assign.txt : a tab-separated file where results of each program and the 
	common result (majority rule) is write for each read in each taxonomic level.
- *_comp.txt : number of common and not common assignments by each taxonomic level.
- *_common.txt : a list of taxa that are assigned equally by the different programs
- *_diff_phymm.txt : a list of taxa that are not assigned equally by the different programs,
	the assignment made by Phymm
- *_diff_nb.txt : a list of taxa that are not assigned equally by the different programs,
	the assignment made by Naïve Bayesian Classifier
- *_sorted_txt : a summary of the above files

If a key_file is provided the next two files are generated:
- *_well.txt : The number of correct assignments made by each program in each taxonomic level
- *_bad.txt : The number of wrong assignments made by each program in each taxonomic level
